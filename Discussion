Developing guidelines to understand where this information exists is partially hidden from view. What you are going to want to put into these documents are influencer and instructional text that helps people use the information by breaking down it's use into meaningful subcategories. Three things come to mind here.  1) Project information that the team of developers, product managers and admins need to do to perform 2) Then there are the code and document repositories that are often involved in keeping a place for the code. It's important to know where they are, what they are used for and how to access them without disturbing the original content. 3) And finally there is the daily project lifecycle files or work files, that I will use and maintain during my four months tenure with the team.  
What happened or what was the demise of the previous person?  What did they do wrong or what didn't they do so they could stay on?
There may have been another person who served in this functon previously.  They often had less that the requisite knowledge and could not find enough common knowledge to be both on the team and helpfully present. 
These will come in time, so keep your questions OPEN.  Being respectful and staying humble.
